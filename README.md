# ex-crl

`ex-crl` is a flexible, scriptable command-line tool for managing and executing HTTP requests in a project-oriented, environment-aware way. It helps automate, test, and organize API workflows with ease.

---

## Minimum Requirements

- **Go**: 1.23 or later
- **Make**: for build/install convenience
- **A text editor**: The `$EDITOR` environment variable should be set (e.g., `vim`, `nvim`, `nano`, `code`, etc.)
- **fzf**: required for fuzzy selection in interactive commands
- **Neovim**: required as the default editor fallback

> **Note:**
> - The `$EDITOR` environment variable is used to open configuration and request files for editing. If not set, `ex-crl` will use `nvim` (Neovim) as the default fallback editor. Please ensure Neovim is installed and accessible in your PATH for the best experience.

## Usage

### Example: From Project Init to Workflow Execution

1. **Initialize a New Project**

   ```bash
   ex-crl init myproject dev https://api.example.com
   ```
   Creates a new project named `myproject` with a `dev` environment and sets the base API URL.

2. **Add HTTP Requests**

   ```bash
   ex-crl add request
   ```
   Follow the prompts to add a new request (e.g., `get-users`). Repeat to add more requests (e.g., `create-user`).

3. **Edit the Workflow**

   ```bash
   ex-crl workflow --edit
   ```
   This opens the workflow configuration in your editor (default: `nvim` or your `$EDITOR`).
   Example workflow file:
   ```json
   {
       "workflow": [
           { "request-name": "get-users", "exec": true },
           { "request-name": "create-user", "exec": true }
       ]
   }
   ```
   Arrange the requests in the order you want them executed and set `"exec": true` for each.

4. **Execute the Workflow**

   ```bash
   ex-crl exec
   ```
   Runs the workflow, executing each request in order. Responses are printed to the terminal.

5. **(Optional) Switch Environments**

   ```bash
   ex-crl project --env
   ```
   Change the active environment if you have multiple (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

## Logging

- Logs are written to `/var/log/ex-crl/ex-crl.log` (system-wide) or `$HOME/ex-crl/logs/ex-crl.log` (user fallback).
- Logs are rotated daily, compressed after a day, and deleted after a week.
